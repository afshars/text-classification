# Text Classification

This repository contains a collection of text classification projects using
classical and deep learning–based NLP approaches. The projects focus on building,
training, and evaluating multi-class text classification models using Python
and TensorFlow/Keras.

Different datasets and feature extraction techniques are explored and compared
across projects.

## Project Scope
The main topics covered in this repository include:

- Text preprocessing and cleaning  
- Feature extraction and vectorization  
- Classical and neural network–based classification models  
- Multi-class text classification  
- Model evaluation and performance analysis  
- Visualization of learned representations  

## Current Projects
- Multi-class text classification on Stack Overflow questions (LSTM-based)
- Word embedding visualization using PCA and UMAP  

(More datasets and approaches will be added over time.)

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- UMAP
